Tracking some configuration files via GitHub

Using `vcsh` allows to use git in $HOME directory without having everything in git. You kind of "enter" the git world only when you want. 
(It can also put different files in different repositories. I could have use another repository for the `bin/` folder for example).


Notes:
- It is important to first ignore all "*" the (untracked) files
- To remove a file from the index: `git rm --cached ~/.oh-my-zsh/oh-my-zsh.sh`
